‚òï Coffee Machine ‚Äì An OOP Python Simulation of a Barista's Daily Grind

üéØ Features:
A clean, modular, object-oriented coffee machine simulation implemented in Python. This version models the real-world caf√© experience with classes representing drinks, menu, coffee maker, and payment system.

Encapsulated ingredient management with classes tracking water, milk, and coffee supplies.

Coin-based payment handling through a dedicated MoneyMachine class (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies).

Menu and drink objects defining drink recipes, costs, and ingredient needs.

Dynamic resource sufficiency checks before processing each order to ensure availability.

Transaction processing with change calculation and profit tracking.

User commands:

Order drinks by name (espresso, latte, cappuccino).

Type report to display current resource levels and profit.

Type off to safely shut down the machine.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use:
Run your main script (python main.py).
Choose your coffee drink when prompted.
Insert coins as requested.
If ingredients and payment are sufficient, the machine will prepare your coffee.
Use report anytime to check machine status.
Use off to exit the program.
