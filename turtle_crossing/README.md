🐢 Turtle Crossing Game – A Frogger-Style Game in Python

🎯 Features
A simple yet engaging arcade-style game built using Python's turtle module. Inspired by the classic Frogger game, players must help the turtle cross a busy street without getting hit by oncoming cars. A great beginner-friendly project to explore object-oriented programming, game loops, and basic collision detection in Python.

🕹️ Gameplay

Use the Up Arrow (↑) to move the turtle forward.

Dodge moving cars that come from the sides.

Reach the top of the screen to level up and increase the challenge.

The game ends if the turtle collides with a car.
