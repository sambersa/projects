🧠 Quiz Game – An OOP Python Trivia Simulation
🎯 Features:
A modular, object-oriented Python quiz game that simulates a simple trivia challenge using real-time user interaction. This project demonstrates clean class-based design while mimicking the behavior of a digital quiz app.

🧩 Core Components:

Question Class: Represents individual quiz questions, encapsulating text and correct answers.

QuizBrain Class: Handles quiz logic, tracks the score, processes user answers, and controls quiz progression.

question_data Source: Supplies the quiz content via a list of dictionaries, allowing easy content updates or expansion.

🔁 Quiz Flow:

Loads a bank of questions and initializes the quiz engine.

Presents each question to the user one-by-one.

Accepts True or False input, checks the answer, updates score.

Displays correct answer and running score after each question.

Ends with a final score summary when all questions are answered.

💬 User Commands:

Enter True or False for each prompted question.

Progresses automatically until no questions remain.

▶️ How to Use:

Run your main script: python main.py

Answer each question with True or False.

View your score update in real time.

Finish the quiz and see your final score summary.
